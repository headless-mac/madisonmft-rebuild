# Improvements log (draft)

This is a running list of suggestions while we rebuild content faithfully.

## SEO + discoverability
- Unique meta descriptions per page (current Squarespace pages often reuse the same default description).
- Structured data (JSON-LD): `LocalBusiness`/`MedicalBusiness`, `Person` (therapist), `FAQPage` on FAQ.
- One primary H1 per page; consistent internal linking between services.
- Sitemap.xml + robots.txt + RSS feed.
- A dedicated “areas served / location” block for Washington, DC + telehealth.

## Mobile + UX
- A clearer “Start here” funnel: Services → FAQs → Contact.
- Improve readability: spacing, type scale, max line length, contrast.

## Functionality
- Blog optimized for maintenance: Markdown posts, tags, RSS, and a simple authoring workflow.
- Add `llms.txt` (and maybe a short “For AI agents” page) with high-signal summaries.
- Accessibility checks: focus states, alt text, semantic headings.
