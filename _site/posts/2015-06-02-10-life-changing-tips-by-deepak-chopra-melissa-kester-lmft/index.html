He practices meditation with P Diddy, does yoga with Tara Stiles, and hangs out with Lady Gaga. Here are ten life changing tips inspired from quotes by Deepak Chopra! 
<ol>
<li>Let Go</li>
</ol>
<p>“Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Nothing Is Impossible</li>
</ol>
<p>“You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Embrace the Unknown.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Even when you think you have your life all mapped out, things happen that shape your destiny in ways you might never have imagined.”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Go with the Flow</li>
</ol>
<p>“Don't try to steer the river.”</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Embrace Stillness</li>
</ol>
<p>“In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.”</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Live a Conscious Life</li>
</ol>
<p>“The way you think, the way you behave, the way you eat, can influence your life by 30 to 50 years.”</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Find Your Purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>“There are no extra pieces in the universe. Everyone is here because he or she has a place to fill, and every piece must fit itself into the big jigsaw puzzle.”</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Let Go of Your Ego</li>
</ol>
<p>“If you want to reach a state of bliss, then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue. Make a decision to relinquish the need to control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those are the three things the ego is doing all the time. ”</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Embrace Your Current Relationships</li>
</ol>
<p>“Whatever relationships you have attracted in your life at this moment, are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment. There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution.”</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Be Open To All Possibilities</li>
</ol>
<p>“Even when you think you have your life all mapped out, things happen that shape your destiny in ways you might never have imagined.”</p>
