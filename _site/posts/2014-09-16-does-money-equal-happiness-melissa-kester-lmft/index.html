We have been told for years that money doesn't buy happiness, however, an article in mindbodygreen.com would disagree.
<p>The article discusses the importance of time and money, that vacations or date night can relieve stress and bring families and couples closer together. It's the experience we remember, not necessarily the objects in and of themselves. It's the excitement we feel when we are in anticipation of receiving an item, not the item itself.</p>
<p>Of course money isn't everything. Money cannot end life's pains, but maybe it can help ease some of the bumps along the way.</p>
