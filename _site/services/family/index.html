# Family Therapy
<p>Family Therapy recognizes that no one is to blame. We explore the family’s strengths and resilience as a resource, with which we model and develop new interactions. This aids in dislodging the family from its currently stuck position. Family therapy serves as a forum to address the unique challenges and concerns of your family. Such issues might include:</p>
<p>Finances
Transitioning to being parents
Changes in Family Structure
Grief, Loss and Chronic Illness
Divorce, Separation, Blended Families
Aging Parents
Boundaries
Hostility
Communication</p>
