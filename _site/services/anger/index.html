# Anger Management
<p>Anger Management acknowledges that anger serves an important purpose. It has protected us and allowed others to possibly hear us. It is our defense and shield. However, as much protection as it has given us, anger has also hurt us and our relationships. In anger management we honor the role anger has served and find new ways to meet the needs we have. By acknowledging the triggers and emotional wounds surrounding them, we are able to communicate what we are looking for to others. Anger management sessions incorporate cognitve behavioral techniques, family therapy and contemplative psychotherapy.</p>
