## MELISSA KESTER, LMFT
<p>Melissa Kester is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Founder of Madison Marriage and Family Therapy, who has clinical experience working with individuals, couples and families. She has served as the Metro Chapter President of the New York State Association of Marriage and Family Therapy. Melissa has been a member of the Hunter College faculty team, instructing graduate students in family therapy.</p>
<p>Personal and professional experiences have led Melissa to harness life’s humor with the joys and challenges of moving towards change. She embraces moments of levity that highlight the ingenuity and repetition we experience in our lives and with our loved ones.</p>
<p>Melissa sees therapy as an opportunity to stretch, and to listen to our minds and bodies. In your space you will be able to slow down and reconnect with yourself. It is a haven of your own design, where you can create or adjust boundaries for protection and healing.</p>
<p>Melissa’s clinical approach is integrative, combining systemic, psychodynamic, creative and contemplative psychotherapy. She recognizes the unique qualities each individual possesses and believes in complimenting them with an appropriate clinical approach. Through open dialogue and active listening, Melissa nurtures an environment for constructive change.</p>
