## Relational Wisdom Intensive |Virtual Workshop for Couples & Individuals
<h2>4 Sundays in March 2026</h2>
<h2>Build the skills that help relationships last.</h2>
<p>Most of us were never taught how to do relationships—especially when stress, resentment, or conflict shows up. The Relational Wisdom Intensive is a live, skills-based virtual workshop designed to help couples and individuals move from reactive patterns into more grounded, connected, and effective communication.</p>
<p>Inspired by the work of Terry Real and facilitated by two Certified Relational Life Therapists , this 4-week intensive blends practical teaching with guided exercises you can use immediately—at home, at work, and in the relationships that matter most.</p>
<h2>What you’ll learn in the Relational Wisdom Intensive</h2>
<p>You’ll practice tools that support real change, including how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recognize the conflict cycle you keep repeating (and interrupt it sooner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify common relational “losing strategies” like being right, withdrawal, control, retaliation, or unbridled self-expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate with more clarity and less defensiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make requests that are specific, honest, and easier for others to respond to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repair after rupture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build relational accountability without shame or scorekeeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen emotional intimacy and teamwork over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who this workshop is for</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Couples who want healthier conflict, deeper connection, and better repair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals who want stronger relationship skills (romantic, family, co-parenting, work)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who feels stuck in “me vs. you” dynamics of an individually empowered society and wants a better way forward</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will leave with a clear framework and practical tools you can keep using.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h2>Is this workshop only for couples?</h2>
<p>No — it’s designed for couples and individuals . Individuals can apply the skills to dating, marriage, family relationships, co-parenting, and even workplace communication.</p>
<h2>Do we have to share personal details in a group?</h2>
<p>You’ll be invited to participate at your comfort level. Teaching is skills-based, with optional reflection and guided practice.</p>
<h2>Is this therapy?</h2>
<p>This is a psychoeducational workshop , not psychotherapy. It can be a powerful complement to therapy, but it is not a substitute for individualized mental health treatment.</p>
<h2>What if we miss a session?</h2>
<p>We aren’t able to offer make-up sessions or discounts for missed classes, but all materials and exercises will be available so you can catch up at your own pace.</p>
<h2>What if we’re in a high-conflict place?</h2>
<p>While we won’t enter into detail about your conflict, many people come in feeling stuck. You’ll learn tools for de-escalation, repair, and clearer communication. If there are safety concerns, individual clinical support may be more appropriate.</p>
