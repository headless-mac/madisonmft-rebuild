In Linda Graham's post about neuroscience and attachment, "The Neuroscience of Attachment," she discusses how our neurons form and how we relate to individuals from infancy into adulthood. Attachment theory has been the working model for many therapists, however, over the last 20 years due to huge technological break through's with brain imaging, we can now have an even deeper understanding of attachments and how we relate one another throughout the course of our lives. Graham writes,"Our earliest relationships actually build the brain structures we use for relating lifelong". What an amazing gift, to be able to understand human relational attachment not only through a psychological lens but a neuro-psychological lens. 

 Graham also writes, "Relating to one another, one on one, couples, families, or in larger social groups, is the most complex thing human beings do, more complex than writing a symphony or running a government or solving global warming, and the need to relate, to be emotionally and socially intelligent, has driven the evolution of the human brain to be the most complex of anything in all of existence." The neuropathways involved when relating to someone else are extremely complex and carry out many functions within a fraction of a second. So the next time you have a dialogue with a friend, family member, or partner, remember that there is more to the dialogue than just words.
