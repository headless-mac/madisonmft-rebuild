Forgiveness is not something we have to give to everyone. We should not to have to forgive those who commit acts that are unforgivable. We are wise enough to know that forgiving is often connected with forgetting and therefore repeating. We are wise enough to protect ourselves and not give forgiveness. However we can move towards knowing and unburdening ourselves with boundaries that protect us. 

 When providing therapy we choose not to force forgiveness on our clients, but let it exist when chosen. [This is a wonderful article that explores why therapists might choose this route.](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/why-i-dont-use-the-word-forgiveness-in-trauma-therapy-0120164)
