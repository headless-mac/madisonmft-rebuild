He practices meditation with P Diddy, does yoga with Tara Stiles, and hangs out with Lady Gaga. Here are ten life changing tips inspired from quotes by [Deepak Chopra](https://www.deepakchopra.com)! 

 1. Let Go 

 “Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future.” 

 2. Nothing Is Impossible 

 “You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.” 

 3. Embrace the Unknown. 

 “Even when you think you have your life all mapped out, things happen that shape your destiny in ways you might never have imagined.” 

 4. Go with the Flow 

 “Don't try to steer the river.” 

 5. Embrace Stillness 

 “In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.” 

 6. Live a Conscious Life 

 “The way you think, the way you behave, the way you eat, can influence your life by 30 to 50 years.” 

 7. Find Your Purpose 

 “There are no extra pieces in the universe. Everyone is here because he or she has a place to fill, and every piece must fit itself into the big jigsaw puzzle.” 

 8. Let Go of Your Ego 

 “If you want to reach a state of bliss, then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue. Make a decision to relinquish the need to control, the need to be approved, and the need to judge. Those are the three things the ego is doing all the time. ” 

 9. Embrace Your Current Relationships 

 “Whatever relationships you have attracted in your life at this moment, are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment. There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution.” 

 10. Be Open To All Possibilities 

 “Even when you think you have your life all mapped out, things happen that shape your destiny in ways you might never have imagined.”
