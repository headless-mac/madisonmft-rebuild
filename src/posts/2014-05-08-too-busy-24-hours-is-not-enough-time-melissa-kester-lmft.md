It is not unusual to have tasks that go into the next day, but now our society lives each day where 24 hours is just not enough. It is so satisfying to leave work with our tasks completed, but this notion seems like a distant memory for most of us. As [Tim Kreider](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0), wrote in the New York Times, "Even children are busy now, scheduled down to the half-hour with classes and extracurricular activities. They come home at the end of the day as tired as grown-ups." 

 How does this happen? How does our day become so overbooked we are working until 2 am the next day? In addition to the numerous tasks on our task list, these days almost seems faster. 

 We recommend reading Kreider's article from the New York Times, [The Busy Trap](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0). His piece is loaded with fun filled reflections of how destructive our system is and begging for us to come outside and enjoy the beauty of the world. 

 Perhaps the world would soon slide to ruin if everyone behaved as I do. But I would suggest that an ideal human life lies somewhere between my own defiant indolence and the rest of the world’s endless frenetic hustle. My role is just to be a bad influence, the kid standing outside the classroom window making faces at you at your desk, urging you to just this once make some excuse and get out of there, come outside and play.
