![Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg](/assets/images/madisonmft/Modern-Romance-3e199e44a0.jpg)

[Aziz Ansari](http://azizansari.com) has frequently explored aspects of modern romance in his standup routine. Like many other comedians, he decided to write a book. Unlike many other comedians, he didn't take his routine and place it in book form. He joined forces with sociologist, [Eric Klinenberg](http://www.ericklinenberg.com), and wrote a book with scientific facts! 

 Ansari's book, [Modern Romance](http://book.azizansari.com), doesn't stray entirely from his comedic roots. There is enough humor around our love lives to keep him going. 

 Now, I have to admit for me this is all hearsay. I have yet to read the book, which came out yesterday. However, after this post I'm off to the store to pick up a copy. I will keep you posted of my review once I'm done. 

 I'm looking forward to taking on a book, which puts humor in a topic I enjoy. For now, enjoy Aziz Ansari and [Jon Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart) discussing the book on yesterday's[Daily Show](http://thedailyshow.cc.com).
