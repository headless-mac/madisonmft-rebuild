<div class="prose">
Aziz Ansari has frequently explored aspects of modern romance in his standup routine. Like many other comedians, he decided to write a book. Unlike many other comedians, he didn't take his routine and place it in book form. He joined forces with sociologist, Eric Klinenberg, and wrote a book with scientific facts! 

 Ansari's book, Modern Romance, doesn't stray entirely from his comedic roots. There is enough humor around our love lives to keep him going. 

 Now, I have to admit for me this is all hearsay. I have yet to read the book, which came out yesterday. However, after this post I'm off to the store to pick up a copy. I will keep you posted of my review once I'm done. 

 I'm looking forward to taking on a book, which puts humor in a topic I enjoy. For now, enjoy Aziz Ansari and Jon Stewart discussing the book on yesterday's Daily Show.
