 Positive Psychology seems to be the next frontier and the evolution of modern psychology. [Martin Seligman](http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/bio.htm) discusses our movement forward with [positive psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) in a [2004 ted talk](http://www.tedtalks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology). How do we quantify happiness, satisfaction, meaning and engagement in our lives? 

 How do we move from decreasing misery and suffering to increasing joy, pleasure, meaning, and engagement? What does this look like for an individual, couple, or family? What does it mean to you?

 These are the questions and curiosities that I believe we hold not only for ourselves but for our loved ones as well. 

 If you know what causes you suffering and pain then transversely, are you able to identify, express and act on what causes you joy, relief, meaning, and engagement?
