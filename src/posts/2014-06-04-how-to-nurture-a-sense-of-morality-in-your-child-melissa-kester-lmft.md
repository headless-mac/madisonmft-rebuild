Adam Grant, a professor of psychology at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote “[Raising a Moral Child](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/opinion/sunday/raising-a-moral-child.html),” for the New York Times Sunday Review. This article has been spreading to friends and family through social media and e-mail. It supports what we see so frequently in session; parents care about raising caring and just children. So how does one go about doing just that?

 Grant states, “g enetic twin studies suggest that anywhere from [a quarter](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-02892-011) to more than [half](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/50/6/1192/%20) of our propensity to be giving and caring is inherited. That leaves a lot of room for nurture…” This leave parents with 75% of the morality lessons.
