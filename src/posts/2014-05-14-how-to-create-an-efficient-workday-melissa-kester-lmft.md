The ideal work day, what a thought. Do you like to have alone time in the morning? Are you always rushing to work, sweating and panting by the time you sit down and read your first email? Do you feel exhausted by the time you get to work? When do you eat lunch and have that second cup of coffee? [Rachel Feltman](http://www.theatlantic.com/rachel-feltman/), addresses these questions with evidence based research and lots of enthusiasm in her article, [How to Structure the Ideal Work Day](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/how-to-structure-the-ideal-work-day-an-evidence-based-guide/360883/), in the Atlantic. 

 Optimizing your work day to maximize your productivity and happiness admittedly isn't a hard science. Differences in body chemistry, sleep routine, personality, profession, and office culture mean that one person's ideal day is another's productivity nightmare. But there are some evidence-based guidelines you can follow to get yourself on the right track. 

 Feltman, takes us through an average work day giving us little helpful tips to make our experience better on an individual basis. She is not proposing we switch jobs, but maybe a better way to rise and shine and be just you. By honoring the simple facts you already know about yourself, for example, if you are more productive in the morning than afternoon. Then you can shift small things in your routine to allow for a more positive work day.
