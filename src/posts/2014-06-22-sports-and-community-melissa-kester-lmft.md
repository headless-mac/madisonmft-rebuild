Since the start of the World Cup this week I noticed an increased sense of community while out and about in the city. I watched people pass by with various tokens supporting their nation's team. Even with all the underhanded behavior of FIFA, we cheer. We love our team and the sense of pride and camaraderie it nurtures in each of us. 

 In an article about Nelson Mandela's views on how sports have the power to change the world, is the mention of how we can come together and unite under one team.

 ["Sport has the power to change the world," Mandela said. "It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers."](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/the-turnstile/nelson-mandela-sport-power-change-world-215933270.html?soc_src=mediacontentstory) I couldn't agree more. After the first week of the World Cup tournament, I think others would agree too.

 Enjoy the games!
