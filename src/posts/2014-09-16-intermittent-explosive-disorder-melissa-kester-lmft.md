The Mayo-Clinic defines this disorder as "Intermittent explosive disorder involves repeated episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts in which you react grossly out of proportion to the situation.

 Signs of Intermittent Explosive Disorder

 - Road Rage
- Domestic Abuse
- Throwing or Breaking Objects
- Other temper tantrums
 People with intermittent explosive disorder may attack others and their possessions, causing bodily injury and property damage. They may also injure themselves during an outburst. Later, people with intermittent explosive disorder may feel remorse, regret or embarrassment."

 It is important to start exploring IED with more depths because it seems to be all around us. Either it's the person having a fit from road rage, a short tempered boss or colleague, a friend who is quick to anger or a partner who is showing signs of an increasing temper. 

 The link below to the Mayo-Clinic website offers in depth information to help clarify the factors, causes,symptoms, and treatment and referral resources for intermittent explosive disorder.
