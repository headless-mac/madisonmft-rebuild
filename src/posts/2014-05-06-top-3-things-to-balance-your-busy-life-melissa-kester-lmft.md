 We complain of feeling tired all the time, of being overwhelmed with duties of work,family, personal health, and commitment to friends. As we attempt to help manage and curb the overwhelming duties involved , we can present with a level of resistance akin to someone stealing our identity.

 This resistance shows that in our current society, which promotes high levels of stress, which leads to feeling overwhelmed (" not enough time in the day to get it all done "), may equal and symbolize a measure of success. Are our busy lives a status symbol of our accomplishments, a proving ground for our achievements, or how we identify ourselves? 

 What happens when our attachments to our stressful lives overtake our fundamental beliefs in who we are and how we want to be in the world. What happens, when highly stressful daily life becomes more of a priority and the norm instead of an intermittent exception?

 Top 3 things to combat "busy life syndrome"
