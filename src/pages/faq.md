### Do you take insurance?
Insurance may cover a substantial portion of the costs of therapy for plans that provide out-of-network behavioral health coverage. Consult your health insurance provider for details.

### How do I pay?
Payment is made at the time of session. You can pay with credit card.

### What is your cancellation policy?
Cancellations need to be made at least 24 hours in advance to avoid the late cancellation fee.
