## FAQ

- Sessions are held weekly, helping maintain the structure necessary for change.
- Insurance may cover a substantial portion of the costs of therapy for plans that provide out-of-network behavioral health coverage. Consult your health insurance provider for details.
- Payment is made at the time of session. You can pay with credit card.
- Cancellations need to be made at least 24 hours in advance to avoid the late cancellation fee.
