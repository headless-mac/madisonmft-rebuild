Most of us were never taught how to do relationships—especially when stress, resentment, or conflict shows up. The Relational Wisdom Intensive is a live, skills-based virtual workshop designed to help couples and individuals move from reactive patterns into more grounded, connected, and effective communication.

Inspired by the work of [Terry Real](https://www.terryreal.com) and facilitated by two Certified Relational Life Therapists, this 4-week intensive blends practical teaching with guided exercises you can use immediately—at home, at work, and in the relationships that matter most.

## What you’ll learn

You’ll practice tools that support real change, including how to:

- Recognize the conflict cycle you keep repeating (and interrupt it sooner)
- Identify common relational “losing strategies” like being right, withdrawal, control, retaliation, or unbridled self-expression
- Communicate with more clarity and less defensiveness
- Make requests that are specific, honest, and easier for others to respond to
- Repair after rupture
- Build relational accountability without shame or scorekeeping
- Strengthen emotional intimacy and teamwork over time

## Who this workshop is for

- Couples who want healthier conflict, deeper connection, and better repair
- Individuals who want stronger relationship skills (romantic, family, co-parenting, work)
- Anyone who feels stuck in “me vs. you” dynamics and wants a better way forward

## FAQ

### Is this workshop only for couples?
No — it’s designed for couples and individuals. Individuals can apply the skills to dating, marriage, family relationships, co-parenting, and even workplace communication.

### Do we have to share personal details in a group?
You’ll be invited to participate at your comfort level. Teaching is skills-based, with optional reflection and guided practice.

### Is this therapy?
This is a psychoeducational workshop, not psychotherapy. It can be a powerful complement to therapy, but it is not a substitute for individualized mental health treatment.

### What if we miss a session?
We aren’t able to offer make-up sessions or discounts for missed classes, but all materials and exercises will be available so you can catch up at your own pace.

### What if we’re in a high-conflict place?
While we won’t enter into detail about your conflict, many people come in feeling stuck. You’ll learn tools for de-escalation, repair, and clearer communication. If there are safety concerns, individual clinical support may be more appropriate.
