## About therapy with Melissa

The therapy room is seen as your safe space where you can come and release the weight you have been holding. Melissa’s therapeutic practice seeks to be a receptive and unbiased resource. She is committed to working collaboratively with you towards healing in a thoughtful, present and emotionally focused manner. Melissa pays particular attention to identifying the personal and interpersonal patterns that may prevent you from engaging in life and relationships the way you desire.
