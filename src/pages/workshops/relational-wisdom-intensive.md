## Relational Wisdom Intensive |Virtual Workshop for Couples & Individuals

## 4 Sundays in March 2026

## Build the skills that help relationships last. 

 Most of us were never taught how to do relationships—especially when stress, resentment, or conflict shows up. The Relational Wisdom Intensive is a live, skills-based virtual workshop designed to help couples and individuals move from reactive patterns into more grounded, connected, and effective communication.

 Inspired by the work of Terry Real and facilitated by two Certified Relational Life Therapists , this 4-week intensive blends practical teaching with guided exercises you can use immediately—at home, at work, and in the relationships that matter most.

## What you’ll learn in the Relational Wisdom Intensive 

 You’ll practice tools that support real change, including how to:

 - Recognize the conflict cycle you keep repeating (and interrupt it sooner)

- Identify common relational “losing strategies” like being right, withdrawal, control, retaliation, or unbridled self-expression.

- Communicate with more clarity and less defensiveness.

- Make requests that are specific, honest, and easier for others to respond to

- Repair after rupture

- Build relational accountability without shame or scorekeeping.

- Strengthen emotional intimacy and teamwork over time.

 ## Who this workshop is for 

 - Couples who want healthier conflict, deeper connection, and better repair

- Individuals who want stronger relationship skills (romantic, family, co-parenting, work)

- Anyone who feels stuck in “me vs. you” dynamics of an individually empowered society and wants a better way forward

 You will leave with a clear framework and practical tools you can keep using.

## FAQ

## Is this workshop only for couples? 

 No — it’s designed for couples and individuals . Individuals can apply the skills to dating, marriage, family relationships, co-parenting, and even workplace communication.

## Do we have to share personal details in a group? 

 You’ll be invited to participate at your comfort level. Teaching is skills-based, with optional reflection and guided practice.

## Is this therapy? 

 This is a psychoeducational workshop , not psychotherapy. It can be a powerful complement to therapy, but it is not a substitute for individualized mental health treatment.

## What if we miss a session? 

 We aren’t able to offer make-up sessions or discounts for missed classes, but all materials and exercises will be available so you can catch up at your own pace.

## What if we’re in a high-conflict place? 

 While we won’t enter into detail about your conflict, many people come in feeling stuck. You’ll learn tools for de-escalation, repair, and clearer communication. If there are safety concerns, individual clinical support may be more appropriate.
