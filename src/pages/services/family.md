# Family Therapy

Family Therapy recognizes that no one is to blame. We explore the family’s strengths and resilience as a resource, with which we model and develop new interactions. This aids in dislodging the family from its currently stuck position. Family therapy serves as a forum to address the unique challenges and concerns of your family. Such issues might include:

 Finances
 Transitioning to being parents
 Changes in Family Structure
 Grief, Loss and Chronic Illness
 Divorce, Separation, Blended Families
 Aging Parents
 Boundaries
 Hostility
 Communication
