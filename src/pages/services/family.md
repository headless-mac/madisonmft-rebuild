Family Therapy recognizes that no one is to blame. We explore the family’s strengths and resilience as a resource, with which we model and develop new interactions. This aids in dislodging the family from its currently stuck position.

Family therapy serves as a forum to address the unique challenges and concerns of your family. Such issues might include:

- Finances
- Transitioning to being parents
- Changes in family structure
- Grief, loss, and chronic illness
- Divorce, separation, blended families
- Aging parents
- Boundaries
- Hostility
- Communication
