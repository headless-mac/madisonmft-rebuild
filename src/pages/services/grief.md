Bereavement Therapy recognizes grief as a normal and natural response when someone in our life passes. In contemporary culture long mourning periods are often unwelcome, leaving us feeling alone in this journey.

Therapy is a time for you to feel supported and held. Bereavement therapy explores the balance of “letting go” and “holding on” through new ways of finding and connecting with our loved ones.

We will journey the five steps of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) and move towards healthy connections with the deceased and living.
