# Individual Therapy

Individual therapy is an exploration of experiences and patterns of behavior, feelings or thoughts that have been the source of concern and distress. While it is often challenging to journey on these paths, when done in a familiar and safe therapeutic relationship, it can result in closer, more fulfilling relationships, a greater sense of emotional well-being and increased self-esteem. Such issues might include:

 Relationship Challenges
 Chronic Illness
 Self-Esteem
 Depression
 Anxiety
 Anger
 Traumatic Experiences
 Perinatal Issues
 LGBTQ
