Individual therapy is an exploration of experiences and patterns of behavior, feelings or thoughts that have been the source of concern and distress. While it is often challenging to journey on these paths, when done in a familiar and safe therapeutic relationship, it can result in closer, more fulfilling relationships, a greater sense of emotional well-being and increased self-esteem.

Such issues might include:

- Relationship challenges
- Chronic illness
- Self-esteem
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Anger
- Traumatic experiences
- Perinatal issues
- LGBTQ
