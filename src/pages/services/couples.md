# Couples Therapy

Couples Therapy is designed for all relationships, no matter the number of partners, race, religion, or how you identify. Our focus in session is on nurturing relational wisdom. In our work together, each partner will be asked to be self-reflective and hold each other with positive regard. This means we start couples therapy, understanding and building compassion for ourselves. We then bring that same warmth and tenderness to our partner. We want to slow down our responsiveness to speak in a way that truly reflects the respect in which we hold ourselves and our loved ones.
